We recently sat down for an open conversation with the Nouvo Ayiti 2075 leadership team. The discussion covered:

- Why 2075 is more than a number — it’s a generational commitment.
- The 11 mission-driven projects and how they interconnect.
- How technology, culture, and unity will rebuild the nation.

Stay tuned for a series of community-driven chats exploring each project area. You are part of the journey.

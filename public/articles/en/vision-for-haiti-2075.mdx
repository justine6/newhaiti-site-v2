# Vision for Haiti 2075

We envision a Haiti that thrives through **unity**, **sustainability**, and **innovation**.

Our roadmap to 2075 is grounded in the belief that a prosperous and peaceful Haiti can emerge through:

- 🏫 **Universal Education**: Every child in school, every adult with learning opportunities.
- 🌾 **Agricultural Renewal**: Food security through local production and climate-smart farming.
- 🏥 **Accessible Healthcare**: Quality care in every commune, from Port-au-Prince to Jérémie.
- 🛠️ **Infrastructure & Technology**: Clean energy, resilient housing, and internet for all.
- 🤝 **Social Cohesion**: Diaspora collaboration, grassroots empowerment, and transparent governance.

## Our Core Values

- **Dignity** — Every Haitian deserves respect and a life of purpose.
- **Justice** — A fair system that protects rights and rewards integrity.
- **Hope** — A collective belief in a brighter, shared tomorrow.
